Introduction

This is the project which i have created with the help of reactJs. As the name suggest this project is basically provides the information regarding weather of a particular city. To make this project i have used an open weather api to fetch the data regarding weather of any particular city which user have entered.

Description

In reactJs, I have used two hooks:-
      1. UseState:- I have used to store and update the some variables.
      2. UseEffect:- This hook is being used to render the page when either user change the city name in search box or unit of temperature so that corresponding api request            can be made.

Although to make this project i have taken a reference from a youtube video but there are two features which i have introduced in it on my own.
      1. Unit of temperature:- This feature helps user to get the temperature in three units celsius, fehraheint and kelvin.
      2. User current location and Temperature:- Along with finding the temperature of any city by typing the city name in search box. This website can also automatically              detect the user current location and tempertaure. For this user need to just allow the location access permission when it will be asked when user visits the website.
